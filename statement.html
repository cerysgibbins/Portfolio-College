                <p>Hello and welcome to my website!</p>
                
                <p>My name is Cerys Gibbins and I will be leaving Neath Port Talbot College in the summer with a National Diploma in IT. I will be going onto higher education to further my skills in Web Development at Swansea Metropolitan University, as I have a strong interest in designing and building websites. I wish to further my education in this field to strengthen my skills and development in Web with the hope of pursuing a career in the web design industry.</p>
                <p>As part of the BTEC Level 3 National Diploma in IT, I have had the opportunity to experience several subjects within the IT industry. The subjects that caught my attention the most were the Web and Media based subjects which has given me the opportunity to design and build websites and interactive media. I received Merit and Distinction grades in the web and graphic units, which then lead me to enrol on a Web Development enrichment course in my spare time. This course has helped me to develop my skills further and allowed me to apply these skills to personal projects. What interests me most in this course is experimenting with the layout and design in the CSS and HTML code. I have also gained experience using Adobe Dreamweaver, PhotoShop, Illustrator and Flash during the course of my studies.</p>
          <p>As a person I am very punctual, organised, responsible, and trustworthy. I enjoy motivating myself to the best that I can, which I believe can help me to improve my programming into creating better websites. I can work independently as in college most of the work needs to be undertaken individually and this has helped me to keep myself motivated and strive to a higher level. Also, being self-determined has helped me to manage my work. I can also work as a team as I completed the Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award course which helped boost my confidence and improve my communication skills. Carrying out this course helped me to improve my leadership skills and also my ability to listen to other people. While I was in Comprehensive School I was part of the Netball team for 5 years which also helped me to improve my teamwork skills.  I believe that these types of skills will help me to excel in this course and will help me to be successful within the web development industry.</p> 
          <p>During my spare time I enjoy socialising with friends and family, listening to music, coding and building websites, keeping fit and helping out charities. I have participated in a Zumbathon for the Sands charity which raises awareness for stillborn babies, during which we raised over £2000. As part of my charitable drive, I completed the Admiral Swansea Bay 10K run with a group of friends. It was extremely tiring but it was an astonishing experience and I’m proud to say that we raised over £400 for the Brain Research Trust.
While at school I was a prefect and this gave me responsibilities that I needed to carry out. I had to be positive and set a good example to younger pupils and help organise school events. I received many awards for my 100% attendance and in 2010 I received an award for Endeavour, recognising my academic achievements in school.</p>
	<p>The reason I want to carry out the Web Development course is because I want to learn as much as possible and become either part of a web design company or a successful entrepreneur. I believe that this is the best course for me to do as it relates to what I would like to do in the future. I can offer the University and clients dedication and enthusiasm.</p>
